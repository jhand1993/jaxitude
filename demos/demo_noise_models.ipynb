    "# JAXitude Noise Models\n",
    "JAXitude provides models for injecting error into 'true' pose data (the actual attitude rate vector at a given time for a spacecraft, for example). Trajectories and orientations generated via a physical simulation are incredibly useful for testing localization, SLAM, and control algorithms.  But in order to test these algorithms, one needs to also simulate measurement error by adding realistic noise to the simulated 'true' data.  For some data, this is trivial.  For example, simulating a measured displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}}^*$ from the true displacement vector $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}}$ of a spacecraft relative to some intertial frame $\\mathcal{R}$ is pretty straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}}^* = \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}} + \\delta\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}}$, where $\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_{\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathcal{R}}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data types used to described dynamical quantities do obey such noise models, though.  Position $\\mathbf{x}$, along with other linear kinematic quantities such as velocity $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}$, are vectors, meaning any two vectors added together result in another vector (as seen above).  Many dynamical quantities are not vectors, though, and require more careful and nontrivial treatment. JAXitude noise models can help with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAX handles random number generation differently than numpy.  Most important is that you need to feed keys into each JAX function that utilizes a random number generator --- JAXitude requires the same thing!  See the tutorial [Pseudo Random Numbers in JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/05-random-numbers.html) for an introduction to and summary of JAX random number API.  \n",

    "## Attitude Noise Models\n",
    "To start, let's consider attitudes.  An object's orientation is described by a rotation, itself which can be represented using various techniques including, but not limited to, rotation matrices $[\\mathbf{R}]$ (also called directed cosine matrices, or DCMs), quaternions $\\beta$, and Rodrigues parameters $q$ or $\\sigma$.  Importantly, rotations are elements of the $\\text{SO}(3)$ group, meaning that you cannot simply add two rotations to get a new rotation, since $\\text{SO}(3)$ is not closed under addition.  Instead, groups are closed under composition.  That means that if we can describe some rotation error, then via composition we can compose the 'true' rotation and the rotation error to get a measured rotation. How the $\\text{SO}(3)$ composition operation is calculated depends on one's chosen representation, which in turn will determine how one composes a rotation error with the 'true' rotation to simulate a measured rotation. \n"

    "### Quaternion Noise Models\n",
    "Quaternions $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{H}_1$, where $\\mathcal{H}_1$ is the set of quaternions of unit length ($|\\beta|=1$), are a valid representation of $\\text{SO}(3)$.  They are particularly useful in practice since they have no singularities that otherwise plague other rotation representations (such as Euler angles).  Adding two unit quaternions $\\beta_p$ and $\\beta_{pp}$ does no yield another quaterion --- instead, quaternion multiplication is used to compose two quaternions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta = \\beta_{p} \\otimes \\beta_{pp}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAXitude's quaternion composition function `compose_quat(b_p, b_pp)` can be found in the `jaxitude.operations.composition` submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively, one might think that we can compose a random 4D vector $\\delta\\mathbf{v} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_{\\mathbf{v}})$, normalize it to get a quaternion error $\\delta\\beta$, and then compose $\\delta\\beta$ with the 'true' quaternion $\\beta$ to simulate a measured quaternion $\\beta^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta^* = \\beta \\otimes \\delta\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not work, unfortunately.  It is incredibly unclear what the covariance $\\Sigma_{\\mathbf{v}}$ would have to be in order to recover a $\\delta\\beta$ that describes small rotations, which is what we want for this error model.  We could instead try to Taylor expand the definition of $\\beta$ around a zero rotation and then sample said angle form a normal distribution centered at zero, but we run into the issue that such a linear approximation will not yield actual quaternions! Furthermore, we aren't even considering the principal rotation axis yet, which determines the rotation plane in which the rotation error is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these issues, JAXitude uses the quaternion exponential map '$\\exp_{\\beta}$' (available via `jaxitude.quaternions.quat_expm(angle, e)`) after calculating the 'true' $\\beta$'s principal rotation axis $\\mathbf{e}$.  The rotation error $\\delta\\theta$ is sampled from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\delta\\theta})$ and used to build the error quaternion $\\delta\\beta$, from which the measured quaternion $\\beta^*$ is calculated via quaternion composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta^* = \\beta \\otimes \\exp_{\\beta}([0, \\delta\\theta\\mathbf{e}]^T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternion noise functionality is found in the class `jaxitude.operations.noise.QuatNoise`.  Let's explore how to simulated measured quaternions by adding principal rotation angle error using `QuatNoise.addnoise()`."
